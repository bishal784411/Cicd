Consider using a module bundler like Webpack or Parcel.\n*   **SEO:** Use descriptive alt text for all images. Ensure the site is mobile-friendly and has a clear structure for search engines.\n*   **Security:** Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.\n*   **User Experience:** Add loading states for asynchronous operations (e.g., form submissions). Provide clear feedback to the user after they submit a booking request.\n*   **Testing:** Implement unit tests and end-to-end tests to ensure the application is working correctly.\n*   **Consider using a framework:** For more complex applications, consider using a front-end framework like React, Angular, or Vue.js.",
